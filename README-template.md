### Built with

### What I learned

- Concerning the HTML part, i fill confident about my DOM. I fill like i'm making less mistakes and from now i always try to test the HTML before and while doing the CSS-part
- Concerning CSS, i found out that a block can contain a background-image and a background-content and how to exclude the footer from the challenge so that screen users can more focus on my challenge and not on the footer
- It's important to set the position of a container to relativ before setting the position of the item to absolute to keep the item inside the container
### Continued development

- responsive images

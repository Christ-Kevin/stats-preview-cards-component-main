# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component

![Design preview for the Stats preview card component coding challenge](./screenshot.jpg)


## The challenge

The challenge is to build out a card component and get it looking as close to the frontendmentor's design as possible.

## Where to find everything

My task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. I will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that i'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

I will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information i'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
